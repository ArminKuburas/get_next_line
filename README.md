# get_next_line


## Description
This repository will hold all my work in regards to the get next line project. This is a project where we have to make a function that is able to read a file descriptor (a text file) and returns the next line within it that it has not returned yet. There is also the bonus one which can handle multiple file descriptors.

   - for example.
